- A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e. nonstandard graph or chart)
- A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or plotly
- A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
- A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
- [x] Backed by SQL database
- [x] Use existing public data set for the database
- [x] Python Flask-powered API
- [x] HTML/CSS for the front-end
- [x] Includes at least one JS library not covered in lecture
- [x] Powered by a data set with at least 100 records
- [x] Include some level of user-driven interaction, e.g. menus, dropdowns
